    <h4>Section One: Understanding HTML Elements</h4>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web
      pages. It consists of a series of elements that describe the structure of
      webpage. Each element is defined by tags, which are enclosed in angle
      brackets. For example, a paragraph is defined using the
      <code>&lt;p&gt; tag.</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each element can also have attributes that provide additional information.
      For example, and image tag might look like this:
      <code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"&gt;.</code> Here,
      <code>src</code> specifies the image source, and alt provides an
      alternative text description.
    </p>

    <h4>Section Two: The Importance of Semantic HTML</h4>

    <p>
      Using semantic HTML elements helps search engines understand the content
      of your webpage better. Each like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,<code
        >&lt;footer&gt;</code
      >
      and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> clearly define the different parts of a
      webpage. This not only aids in SEO but also improves accessibility for
      uers relying on screen readers.

    <h4>Section Three: CSS and Styling</h4>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to control the layout and
      presentation of HTML elements. With CSS, you can change the color, font,
      spacing, and positioning of elements on the page. For example:
    </p>

    <pre>
        body {
            backgroud-color: #f0f0f0;
            color: #333;
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
      This simple CSS rule changes the backfroung color of the entire page and
      sets the text color to a darker shade for better readability.
    </p>
    <h4>Conslusion</h4>
