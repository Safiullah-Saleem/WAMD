        A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera
        indica. It originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar,
        Bangladesh, and northeastern India.M. indica has been cultivated in
        South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of
        modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian
        type".

        An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp.,
        among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees
        are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the
        genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
        ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for
        thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by
        European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance
        in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian
        tradition.

        A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of
        the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of
        fruit, generally occurring in clusters. The cultivation of grapes began
        approximately 8,000 years ago, and the fruit has been used as human food
        throughout its history. Eaten fresh or in dried form (as raisins,
        currants and sultanas), grapes also hold cultural significance in many
        parts of the world, particularly for their role in winemaking. Other
        grape-derived products include various types of jam, juice, vinegar and
        oil.
